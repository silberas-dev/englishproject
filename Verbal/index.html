	Malcolm-X’s “Ballot or the Bullet” speech. Another classic from a renowned marxist. Malcom-X understood that black revolutionaries need to exercise their right to vote, but also need to be prepared to use violence. Not only does it manage to see both sides and advocate for both sides, but also manages to unite the many revolutionaries watching and listening. This credibility is pretty concrete, although never holding a proper revolution Malcom-X still encouraged change through not only his words but his actions, violent and non-violent.

        <p class="p_text">	The speech referenced here is a speech made by Malcolm-X, a popular marxist civil rights leader.

This is what this speech is discussing, the need for a violent revolution to change the system as a whole, not just the racist system but the capitalistic system.
