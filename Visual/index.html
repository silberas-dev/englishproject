        <h2>Black Lives Matter Street Mural</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p class="p_text">The picture seen below is a picture of a Black Lives Matter mural in the middle of a street, inspired by the one in Washington D.C.. This came as a result of a mass political movement, calling for an end to systemic violence in relation to the George Floyd murder. The reason I chose this picture is because it brings a big point up, what do these events accomplish. When looking at the street murals, what did this do? Sure it spread a message, and by no means am I against the artists or people who wanted to spread this message. What I want to ask is did this bring change, did this street art actually change anything? Let’s look at the one in Washington D.C., did that accomplish anything? The local government changed the street name to “Black Lives Matter St.,” but the government didn’t do anything to stop police violence. They did nothing to prevent further issues, in fact increasing military and police spending which was used AGAINST BLM protestors. The reason these murals were made was to appease the non-violent crowd, but even King would be opposed to this because it achieves nothing.

        <h2>Stonewall Riot</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p class="p_text">The picture seen below is one of the many photos of police violence during Stonewall. What many people don’t understand is that Stonewall was a riot, people were throwing bricks, specifically at police. What this did for the gay rights movement was indispensable. Not only did it bring mass attention to the gay rights issue, but it also was the first ever action of the gay rights movement. It also gave people like Marsha P. Johnson a platform to speak. It wasn’t all violence either, after Stonewall a lot of non-violent protests popped up, but they couldn’t have done it without the riots. It is also important to realize that the police were the most violence force, beating and shooting protestors. Most protestors targeted police cars, not actual officers. There were violent actions, just not coming from the protestors.
