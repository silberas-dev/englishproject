      </section>

      <section>
        <p class="p_text">Lenin’s “What is to be done?” This is a classic in Marxist literature, describing the path needed for a revolution and why we need a revolution. It is specifically mentioning the Russian empire, but the information is not exclusive to this scenario. This has great credibility as Lenin is a renowned revolutionary who actually held a revolution that changed the history of Russia forever. Through the use of a violent revolution, Lenin was able to achieve a change from a monarchy to a dictatorship of the proletariat, even if it was short lived.

      </section>

      <section>
        <p class="p_text">This is an excerpt from a newspaper discussing guerilla warfare and tactics. This is extremely relevant to the question at hand as this is using violence for change. This is also coming from Ernesto “Che” Guevara, an accomplished communist and revolutionary who benefitted the lives of thousands of Cubans through violence. Because of this, this resource is of great credibility, coming from a revolutionary who actively changed the lives of thousands for the better through violence.

      </section>

      <section class="p_text">
        <p>This is a book containing a large amount of quotes from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung regarding everything from Culture to Women, including revolution. I want to specifically focus on the chapters, “People’s war,” “Revolutionary Heroism,” and “Education and Training the Troops.” To discuss validity and notability, Mao Tse-Tung and the Chinese Communists used violence to fight against Japanese Imperialism during WW2, combatting the invasions of Japanese troops, without the aid of America. As a result the Chinese Communists grew extremely high in popularity, and held a civil war in which they used violence (again) to win over the nationalists. Mao and the communists founded the CCP and the People's Republic of China on socialist ideals, using violence to carry them out. Not against the people, but against the oppressors. The Chinese nationalists wanted a fascist state, they were chased off and killed. The capitalists and landlords wanted to exploit the workers, and they were killed. This is how violence was used in Mao’s era.
